If you find a price difference of 30% and so on, the best you will get is 1%, which is more like a waste of time or a profit that can be generated through spot trading.', '2023-11-13 00:54:30');

The one who creates & gives the artificial designs it to show things from its own perspective. So, the artificial light users will think like him otherwise they will be replaced.

Just some tip on touching up futures, then it would really be that wise on not touching up this space not unless you do have that sufficient experience on Spot. Better leave it for now and            make yourself that familiarize or make yourself that get used to spot before touching futures. This would be the best thing to have for now.  2.  A market would really be that compose of buyers and sellers on which it would really be just that common sense that if there\'s someone who buys the there\'s someone who do sell in the other side     in regardless on what you are really dealing with. They do only differ on the leverage you are really that setting on, the higher then the more faster you would really be that liquidated.  Whether you would really be taking up my advise or not in regarding about futures but its up to you if you could bare up the risks but it seems that you are complete noob then better not engage on this one for now.', '2023-11-13 01:02:36');

That\'s why we have scalpers, but there\'s no specific time or day to consider bitcoin as a long-term investment; it depends on the investor or the trader. That doesn\'t mean bitcoin is long-term; you will just let it sit there. You can use some for trading to earn money because we have needs in everyday life.  Altcoin doesn\'t mean you will lose money or that it is not good for trading; it, of course, depends on the traders. Many traders take advantage of altcoins, which indicates trading will depend on the skill and knowledge of a trader. So any coin can be profitable; you just need to find or take advantage of it. If you keep losing altcoins, then it\'s the trader\'s fault, not the coins. I personally trade not just bitcoin but other altcoins and shitcoins, and so far it\'s gone well.', '2023-11-13 01:03:59');

I use it more often than other search engines, as I want to know the use of it. So far, it has given me a thorough answer to any of the questions that I have. If not, it does send me links to research a subject or thought.  So, I do find it rather useful in my day-to-day work. It helps me improve my writing skills and knowing that there is a tool like ChatGPT can really help others. There is a wide variety of knowledge out there in our hands and it is in one source.  I hope this can only be put to good use and there must be an age limit. For something so brand new there will be kinks and bumps on the road. I do certainly not want to see ChatGPT fail.

With 10x leverage, you are most favorite customers of centralized exchanges because your positions will be liquidated easily by their automated tools and they will get richer by money liquidated from you.  If you set your target like earning a fixed amount of money such as $50 a day from trading, it is a wrong approach already. Because it will cause pressure on you and you will always have to trade daily.  You must know, trading too often will cause you loss because your brain must be fresh, calm to trade successfully and you must trade only if it\'s good entry to open your position. If you don\'t see good entry, don\'t trade even days or weeks.', '2023-11-13 01:08:34');

Arbitrage bots don\'t work when you can\'t get money out of an exchange you\'re doing arbitrage on and you can\'t balance your accounts! That\'s why the kimchi premium existed, because of capital controls, it was nearly impossible to do arbitrage!  Back to the initial question, it\'s not about getting around capital controls but simply the lack of interest from Korean investors to pay that much compared to others, they got burned twice, the FOMO is no longer there, so there is no premium anymore. Add on top of this the constant regulations, the fact that you no longer can withdraw coins to non-verified external wallets and you get the picture.', '2023-11-13 01:09:06');

Then it will lead us to ruin and destroy our community and make us dependent on institutions which will become a curse to the next generation.It is a very good medium or management for me personally which helps us a lot.', '2023-11-13 01:17:34');
